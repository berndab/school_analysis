# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook applications that are programed in Python 3 which analyzes school and student academic performance data for a school district and generates student performance statistics based on the following student groupings:

* by district
* by school
* by grade
* by school spending per student
* by school size
* by school type
